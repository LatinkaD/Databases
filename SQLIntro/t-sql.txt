	T-SQL
- Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate
with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, 
regardless of the user interface of the application.
- Transact-SQL provides the following statements to declare and set local variables: DECLARE,
SET and SELECT.
- Keywords for flow control in Transact-SQL include BEGIN and END, BREAK, CONTINUE, 
GOTO, IF and ELSE, RETURN, WAITFOR, and WHILE.
- In Transact-SQL, both the DELETE and UPDATE statements allow a FROM clause to be added, 
which allows joins to be included.
- Beginning with SQL Server 2005, Microsoft introduced additional TRY CATCH logic to support 
exception type behaviour. This behaviour enables developers to simplify their code and leave 
out @@ERROR checking after each SQL execution statement.
