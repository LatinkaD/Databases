	SQL 
	
- SQL  is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational 
database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
- Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a 
data definition language (DDL) and a data manipulation language (DML).
- The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, and data access control.
- SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. 
- The following is an example of a SELECT query that returns a list of expensive books. The query retrieves
all rows from the Book table in which the price column contains a value greater than 100.00.
The result is sorted in ascending order by title. The asterisk (*) in the select list indicates that all columns 
of the Book table should be included in the result set.

SELECT *
 FROM  Book
 WHERE price > 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
