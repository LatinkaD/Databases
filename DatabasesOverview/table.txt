	Table
	
- A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.
- In relational databases and flat file databases, a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns 
(which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.
- Table is another term for relation; although there is the difference in that a table is usually a multiset 
(bag) of rows where a relation is a set and does not allow duplicates.
