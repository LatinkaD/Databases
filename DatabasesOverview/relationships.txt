	Relationships between tables
	
- One-to-One Relationships
	In a one-to-one relationship, each row in one database table is linked to one and only one 
other row in another table. In a one-to-one relationship between Table A and Table B, each row in
Table A is linked to another row in Table B. The number of rows in Table A must equal the
number of rows in Table B.
	If a database table contains a few columns of data that is frequently used and the remaining
columns being infrequently used, the database designer may split the single table into 2 
tables linked through a one-to-one relationship.

- One-to-Many Relationships 
	In a one-to-many relationship, each row in the related to table can be related to many rows
in the relating table. This effectively save storage as the related record does not need to 
be stored multiple times in the relating table.
	For example, all the customers belonging to a business is stored in a customer table while 
all the customer invoices are stored in an invoice table. Each customer can have many
invoices but each invoice can only be generated for a single customer.

- Many-to-Many Relationships
	In a many-to-many relationship, one or more rows in a table can be related to 0, 1 or 
many rows in another table. A mapping table is required in order to implement such a relationship.
	For example, all the customers belonging to a bank is stored in a customer table while all the
bank's products are stored in a product table. Each customer can have many products 
and each product can be assigned to many customers.
