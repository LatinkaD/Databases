	Difference between Primary and Foreign Key
	
- Primary key
		A table typically has a column or combination of columns that contain values that uniquely
	identify each row in the table. This column, or columns, is called the primary key (PK) of the
	table and enforces the entity integrity of the table. Because primary key constraints 
	guarantee unique data, they are frequently defined on an identity column.

- Foreign key
		A foreign key (FK) is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and 
	enforce a link between the data in two tables to control the data that can be stored in 
	the foreign key table. In a foreign key reference, a link is created between two tables
	when the column or columns that hold the primary key value for one table are referenced
	by the column or columns in another table. This column becomes a foreign key in the 
	second table.
