	Transactions
	
- A transaction has four key properties that are abbreviated ACID. ACID is an acronym for for Atomic Consistent Isolated Durability.
Atomic means that all the work in the transaction is treated as a single unit. Either it is all performed or none of it is. 
Consistent means that a completed transaction leaves the database in a consistent internal state. 
Isolations means that the transaction sees the database in a consistent state. This transaction operates on a 
consistent view of the data. If two transactions try to update the same table, one will go first and then the other
will follow. Durability means that the results of the transaction are permanently stored in the system.
