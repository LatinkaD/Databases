	RDBMS Main Functions
	
- A relational database is a persistent storage mechanism that enables you to both store data and optionally 
 implement functionality.
- DBMSs are used to store the information required by applications built using procedural technologies 
 such as COBOL or FORTRAN, object technologies such as Java and C#, and component-based technologies such 
 as Visual Basic.
- The most common use of RDBMSs is to implement simple CRUD – Create, Read, Update, and Delete – functionality. 
 For example an application could create a new order and insert it into your database. It could read an existing
 order, work with the data, and then update the database with the new information. It could also choose to delete 
 an existing order, perhaps because the customer has cancelled it.
- Different users may have different CRUD cycles based upon the requirements of the system. A customer, 
 for instance, might have the ability to create an account, retrieve it upon return to a website, update 
 billing information, or delete it if necessary. An operations manager, by contrast, might create product 
 records, call them up as needed, modify packaging or raw materials details or delete it if the product
 was discontinued.
