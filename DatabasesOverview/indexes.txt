	Indexes
	
- Index is a physical structure contains pointers to the data.
- Advantages
	- Increased performance: There is no need to access a row
	in the database from an index structure, so you can reduce the total number of I/O operations needed to retrieve data.
	- Reduced table space: Because you do not need to link to a row in a table, there is no need to store the ROWID 
	in the index. The overall space required for the table is reduced.
	- Presorted data: The data in the leaf nodes is already sorted by the value of the primary key.
	
- Disadvantages
	- You must have a primary key on the table with a unique value.
	- You cannot have any other indexes on the data.
	- You cannot partition an index-organized table.
	- An index-organized table cannot be a part of a cluster.
