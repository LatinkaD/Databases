	NoSQL
	
- A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled 
in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this 
approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling, and finer control over availability. 
The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differ from those 
used in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL and others faster in 
relational databases. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the 
problem it must solve.
- NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.
- There have been various approaches to classify NoSQL databases, each with different categories 
and subcategories. Because of the variety of approaches and overlaps it is difficult 
to get and maintain an overview of non-relational databases.
